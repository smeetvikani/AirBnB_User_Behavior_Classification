### <a name="section-a"></a>1.  Project Overview
##### The goal of this project was to Classify new Air BnB users as to their destination preferance sololy based on online activty and static user data. 
* Static User Data such as: 
	* Device Used
	* Signup Method
	* Age
* Dynamic User Data (Sessions) :
	* Active Session Time
	*  Buttons Clicked
	*  Active Browser type
* 10 Million User activity data points were used for the analysis. 
* A total of 190 Features were generated using these data points. 

#### Project Broken Down into two Phases: 
* Multiclass Classification
* Binary Classification

### <a name="section-b"></a>2.  Tools Used

#### Sklearn, Postgres SQL, Flask, Plotly, D3, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, HTML, CSS,.

#### 3. Algorithms used: 
*   Logistic Regression
*   KNN
*   SVM (Support Vector Machines)
*   Ensamble Random Forest Classifier 
*   Decision Tree Classifier
*   Tuning: Sklearn GridSearchCV

### <a name="section-b2"></a>3.  Data Distribution
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on the age distribution of the target demographic. Below is a plot created using Seaborn, represents the histogram of average Air B%B user age.

### <a name="section-c"></a> Multivariate Classification Models

##### Phase 1: Choosing Algorithm

Tested Initial Data using Various Models: Each Model was Cross Validated Using Test Sets. Below is the test data model summary. 
![Map](http://downloadforpc.net/Metis/project4/plots/compare.jpeg)
Best Performing model was Random Forest Classifier. There results were not significat due to high class imbalance.

### <a name="section-c2"></a> Phase 2, Binary Classification Model
Due to high class imbalance, we were unable to get significant results from multivariate classificaiton. In order to derive significant results from the data, I narrowed down the classes to find just users travelling in the States vs the rest of the world. 

As you can see below Logistic Regression, outperformed random forest classifier by a large margin. Scoring Metric was F1 Score, with a good balance of accuray and recall.

Listed below are the features with the highest impact on the model. R Squared of this model remained consistant with the test set, we can conclude there was no overfitting.

### <a name="section-c3"></a> Phase 2, Establish Threshold

Challenge: Choosing the right threshold. How to determine that this is the most effective threshold?

* Solution 1, Precision Recall Curve: It helps determine a good balance between precision and recall.
* Solution 2, Create a custom Cost Function.  


##### Testing the threshold via custom cost function: 

* TP=Advertised Correctly. Gain 1.5$
* FN= Miss Opportunity. Loss  1/2$ 
* FP= Wrong Demographic. Loss 1/2$ 
* Best Threshold  .35
* Profit Margin of 4,000$ with this model and threshold.

### <a name="section-e"></a> Final Results: 

Best Performing model for the binary dataset was Logistic Regression. Model Accurately predicts 82% percent of us Customers, while minimizing loss on False Positives. 

Details on the model below: 

| Metric   |      Before TH      |  After TH |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Recall |  .74 | .82 |
| Precision |  .47   |   .43 |
| F1 | .58  |    .57 |
